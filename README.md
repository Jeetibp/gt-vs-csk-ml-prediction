# IPL 2023 Final â€“ GT vs CSK: Run & Wicket Prediction  

## Overview  
This project builds an **interactive machine learning model** to predict **runs and wickets** in the IPL 2023 final between **Gujarat Titans (GT) and Chennai Super Kings (CSK)**. The model uses historical IPL data and real-time match conditions for prediction.  

## Features  
- Predicts **runs and wickets** dynamically.  
- Interactive visualization using **ipywidgets**.  
- Machine learning model trained on IPL data.  

## Installation  
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:  

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn ipywidgets matplotlib
```

Enable Jupyter widgets if not already enabled:  

```bash
jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension --sys-prefix
```

## Usage  
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook (`ipl_final_prediction.ipynb`).  
2. Use the interactive sliders to set match conditions.  
3. The model predicts runs & wickets dynamically.  

## Model Details  
- **Algorithm:** Linear Regression  
- **Features Used:**  
  - Batting Team, Bowling Team, Over Number, Current Score, Wickets, Run Rate, Last 30 Balls Stats, etc.  
- **Training Data:** Past IPL match data  

## Contributing  
Feel free to raise issues or submit pull requests for improvements.  

## License  
This project is open-source and available under the **MIT License**.
